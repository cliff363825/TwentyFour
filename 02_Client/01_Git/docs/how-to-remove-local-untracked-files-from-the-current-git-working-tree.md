# [How to remove local (untracked) files from the current Git working tree](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61212/how-to-remove-local-untracked-files-from-the-current-git-working-tree)

How do you delete untracked local files from your current working tree?



> ## [git-clean](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean) - Remove untracked files from the working tree
>
> ### Synopsis
>
> ```
> git clean [-d] [-f] [-i] [-n] [-q] [-e <pattern>] [-x | -X] [--] <path>…
> ```
>
> ### Description
>
> Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not under version control, **starting from the current directory**.
>
> Normally, only files unknown to Git are removed, but if the `-x` option is specified, ignored files are also removed. This can, for example, be useful to remove all build products.
>
> If any optional `...` arguments are given, only those paths are affected.

------

Step 1 is to show what will be deleted by using the `-n` option:

```
# Print out the list of files which will be removed (dry run)
git clean -n
```

Clean Step - **beware: this will delete files**:

```
# Delete the files from the repository
git clean -f
```

- To remove directories, run `git clean -f -d` or `git clean -fd`
- To remove ignored files, run `git clean -f -X` or `git clean -fX`
- To remove ignored and non-ignored files, run `git clean -f -x` or `git clean -fx`

**Note** the case difference on the `X` for the two latter commands.

If `clean.requireForce` is set to "true" (the default) in your configuration, one needs to specify `-f` otherwise nothing will actually happen.

Again see the [`git-clean`](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean) docs for more information.

> **`-f`, `--force`**

> If the Git configuration variable clean.requireForce is not set to false, git clean will refuse to run unless given `-f`, `-n` or `-i`.
>
> **`-x`**
>
> Don’t use the standard ignore rules read from .gitignore (per directory) and `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude`, but do still use the ignore rules given with `-e` options. This allows removing all untracked files, including build products. This can be used (possibly in conjunction with git reset) to create a pristine working directory to test a clean build.

> **`-X`**

> Remove only files ignored by Git. This may be useful to rebuild everything from scratch, but keep manually created files.

> **`-n`, `--dry-run`**

> Don’t actually remove anything, just show what would be done.

> **`-d`**

> Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files. If an untracked directory is managed by a different Git repository, it is not removed by default. Use `-f` option twice if you really want to remove such a directory.
